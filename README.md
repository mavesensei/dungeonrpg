# INTRODUCTION 

First of all this mini-game created by mavesensei. This game based the structures of RPG(Role Play Game). So firstly the player has to be select his/hers own play style so I created 3 different classes which is “Warrior, Archer, Mage”(those classes are pretty common in rpg games) than I tried to give every class its own previlage,<br> 
for example: the strength skill of warrior pretty much than archer but because its a warrior his/hers move ability is worse than archer, let me explain this; for example, in a fight if you can’t kill the enemy mob(mobiles) you should run from the fight because you do not want to be dead and don’t want to be lose your all progress. In that case you need to use the command “flee” and the luck of the 6 faced dice and your dexterity skill points you can actually run from the enemy mob. This is a basic explanation for classes and their abilities.<br>
Also in-game I thought like 1 kind of mob is just laziness who wants to fight with just 1 kind of enemy so I created 2 races which they are “Goblins and Skeletons” for goblin types I created 4 types of goblins which called “Normal Goblin, Archer Goblin, Shield Goblin and lastly Boss(FATASS) Goblin” every one of them has different hps(Health Points) and aps(Attack Powers) but that didn’t make me very happy than I added a level system for player and mobs, every mob has a 10 faced dice before the faced with player and result of the dice gaves goblins level and by that level the goblins aps is increase. And now Skeletons (to be honest I just copied the goblin features and make less healthed because I wasn't thought about the process will be so long while I was creating the Skeletons, so the same things goes for Skeletons.) but obviously Skeletons not just copycats they has unique abilities like “AMBUSH” while player deciding his/hers choice “Walk to it/’Wait’” this Wait option gives the player increase their healths without using “Health Potions” but also risky, because of the "Skeleton Ambush" everytime player types “Wait” in background a 2 faced dice rolling and if its success his/hers hp bar in any condition takes –15 damage because its an Ambush, so thats the Skeleton part. Game has save&load system because noone wants to lose their progress because closing a screen. Last but atleast the health potion system can storageable has a drop rate in every mobs loot %10 chance and usable in any position.
