# dungeonrpg
Its a sample for coding an text based rpg game, it has three type of class, level up system, I didn't add a map for game I let that to your imagination. You can take this as sample and improve it the way you like for example, you can create another mobs or you can create a dungeon map and dungeon levels for each mob. But in this version of code it just a linear dungeon corridor and the four type goblin attacks you while you walk to it. I hope you like it.

# It has<br>
+Level up system<br>
+Combat system<br>
+Three different classes<br>
+Healing system<br>
+Seven different mobs<br>
+While you are waiting and healing mobs can attack you %50<br>
+Save/Load system (It has bug for now)<br>
+Health Potions (drop rates/usable while battles)<br>
#  It doesn't has<br>
-Game map<br>
-A story<br>
-Inventory system<br>
-Different places(rooms)<br>

Like I mention it earlier that's a sample, I will add the map, story, inventory system too.
