# dungeonrpg
Its a sample for coding an text based rpg game, it has three type of class, level up system, I didn't add a map for game I let that to your imagination. You can take this as sample and improve it the way you like for example, you can create another mobs or you can create a dungeon map and dungeon levels for each mob. I hope you like it.
