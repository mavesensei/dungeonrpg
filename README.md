# dungeonrpg
Its a sample for coding an text based rpg game, it has three type of class, level up system, I didn't add a map for game I let that to your imagination. You can take this as sample and improve it the way you like for example, you can create another mobs or you can create a dungeon map and dungeon levels for each mob. But in this version of code it just a linear dungeon corridor and the four type goblin attacks you while you walk to it. I hope you like it.

#It has:                                      It doesn't has:<br>
+Level up system                             -Game map<br>
+Combat system                               -A story<br>
+Three different classes                     -While you healing(wait) mobs doesn't attacks you.<br>
+Healing system                              -Inventory system<br>
+Four different mobs                         -Different places(rooms)<br>
                                             
Like I mention it earlier that's a sample, I will add the map, story, battles while healing, inventory system too.
